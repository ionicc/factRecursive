# factRecursive
A simple program to find the factorial of a number through recursion.

Some people asked me to write this program so here it is :)

This is written for prople who have just started leaerning the concepts of recursion.
Although this is in C, It can be ported to Java, Javascript or python with the same logic.

If you have any doubts please raise an issue or If you have a better method please put up a pull request and I'll look through it.

Happy coding :D
